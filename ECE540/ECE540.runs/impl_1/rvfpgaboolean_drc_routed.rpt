PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell tap/dmi[31]_i_1 (pin tap/dmi[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A3*A2))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 ram/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin ram/mem_reg_0_0/ENARDEN (net: ram/mem_wr_en) which is driven by a register (veerwolf/axi_intercon/axi_xbar/gen_slv_port_demux[1].i_axi_demux/gen_demux.i_w_fifo/mem_q_reg[0][0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
